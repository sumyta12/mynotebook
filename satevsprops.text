1 .here state is more private because it use in component you can imagine it like when you write basic js or c code 
   outside of the function you can not use local variable state is just like that.

2.porps is just like a placeholder you pass it form outside from the component or you can say props is just like placeholder
  for other component and you can already assume that we use that placeholder value as aslo value but when we try to update
  that value inside other component that case we need the state beacuse state is a local variable
